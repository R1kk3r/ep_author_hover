# Differences from original

* Fix user color issue when searching from historical
* Fix warning issue (console) when <span> are not found (.closest())
* Fix "Me" and "Anonymous user" color (transparent to white)
* Fix author id length issue
* Opacity a bit darker (better if lot of text in the pad)
* Include JQTip libraries for futur change

# TODO

* use JQTip (work in progress...)
* Test in IE
* Settings for font size/background color switch
